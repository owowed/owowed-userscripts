# owowed-userscripts

This repository contains a collection of my public userscripts for various websites. Userscripts are small JavaScript programs that can be installed in web browsers to add or modify website functionality.

## Installation

To use any of the userscripts in this repository, you'll need a userscript manager extension installed in your web browser. Here are some popular userscript managers:
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
- [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)

Once you have a userscript manager installed, simply click on the userscript file you want to use in this repository, then click the "Raw" button to open the file in raw format. Your userscript manager should automatically detect the file and prompt you to install it.

## Available Userscripts

- **YouTube Raw Transcript**: A userscript that adds a button in the video's transcript panel, with the functionality of generating a raw video transcript you can copy-paste. License: LGPL-3.0.
